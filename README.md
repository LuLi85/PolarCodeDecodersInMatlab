# PolarCodeDecodersInMatlab
This is the Matlab realization of Polar Decoders, including CA-SCL, Fast CA-SCL and BP decoder.

The .PDF file is in a textbook-style, including fundamental knowledge about polar code. 

Polar codes  practically projected in the 5G control channel. The 3GPP RAN1 has compeleted the standard written about polar before the year 2018. Until now, there are still a lot of essential problems need to be research about therotical channel polarization, and also practical hardware implementation of decoder.
